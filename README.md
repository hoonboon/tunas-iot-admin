# Tunas IOT Solution

# Pre-reqs
To build and run this app locally you will need a few things:
- Install [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/)
- Install [VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/)

# Getting started
- Clone the repository
```
git clone --depth=1 https://github.com/XXX.git <project_name>
```
- Install dependencies
```
cd <project_name>
npm install
```
- Build and run the project
```
npm run build
npm start
```
Or, if you're using VS Code, you can use `cmd + shift + b` to run the default build task (which is mapped to `npm run build`), and then you can use the command palette (`cmd + shift + p`) and select `Tasks: Run Task` > `npm: start` to run `npm start` for you.

> **Note on editors!** - TypeScript has great support in [every editor](http://www.typescriptlang.org/index.html#download-links), but this project has been pre-configured for use with [VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/). 

Finally, navigate to `http://localhost:3000` and you should see the template being served and rendered locally!
